//This test does a similar thing as the above, but it instead locates the calendar input field using the ARIA 
//identifies "textbox" and the actual name on the web page "Completion date"
//it tells the comp to type the date in that field
//and then tells it to CHECK that what we TOLD IT to type in IS WHAT is typed in 

//In an expect statement it might matter how you present the expected statement eg. (/..../ or "")

//EXPLANATION FROM CHAT GPT
/*This line verifies that the value of the "input" element matches the regular expression /2023-05-16/. 
//The test will pass if the value matches the regular expression and fail if it does not.
Overall, this test case navigates to a web page, locates an input element, types a date string into it, 
and verifies that the value of the input element matches a specific format.*/

//In this test - we are asking the computer to:
//navigate to the url -> select the input field -> typing wash dog -> 
//->selecting the calendar input field -> typing in the date
//selecting the button -> clicking the button...
//we're yet to get the computer to CHECK that what it has entered is what it SHOULD have entered
    //but we haven't yet figured out how to present the info in line 60 that it can read

    //WE CAN LOCATE THE LIST ITEM BY...
    //inspecting the page when the list item has been added - there is an element called "span" which holds the list item
    //the team whose code we screenshotted instead told the computer to look for info in two different elements and see if it contains what we're looking for.
